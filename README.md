# Clue Teleport Helper

A RuneLite plugin that shows the 5 closest teleports to your clue scroll location and highlights the teleport items in your inventory.

## Features

- **Top 5 Teleport Display**: Persistent overlay showing the closest teleports with exact tile distances
- **Color-Coded Distances**: Deep pink (≤20), hot pink (21-50), light pink (>50 tiles)
- **Inventory Highlighting**: Highlights relevant teleport items with a hot pink border
- **Auto-Updates**: Refreshes every game tick as you progress through clues

## Why Use This?

Unlike existing clue helpers that focus on solutions or routing, this plugin helps you **choose the best teleport** by comparing multiple options at a glance with exact distances.

## Requirements

Requires the official Clue Scrolls plugin to be enabled.
